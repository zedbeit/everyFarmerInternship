Coding Challenge: 
Matrix Multiplication: Giving two teams, Team A and Team B, with their number of Golds, Silvers, and Bronze respectively (represented as 2 * 3 matrix): Each of these medals have their own score known as oldScores and newScores (represented as 3 * 2 matrix). Get the final score (in terms of the old and new form of scoring) of each team by multiplying their medals with their respective score using matrix multiplication. At the end of your program a (2*2 matrix) should be the final answer. Hint: Use Java's Multi Dimensional array to achieve this. The teams number of medals(G, S, B) would be a multiDimensional array while the scores would be another multiDimensional array, Then you multiply both arrays and get your  2*2 arrays as your result.
